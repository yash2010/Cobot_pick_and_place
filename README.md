Designing and testing a robotic cell can be a time consuming and costly process. This can make it hard for
beginners to get started in the field of robotics, and it can slow down the development process for an
experienced roboticist. Therefore, it is important to work with a simulation software. This is about the simulation of basic operations of an industrial robot in a robotics simulation software (RoboDK). 
This simulation is then transferred to a real KUKA manipulative arm
